You will be given information about specific audio.

Your task is to make a prompt that can measure the auditory knowledge about animals.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Generation Criteria:

Make a prompt if the reference audio information is related to audio knowledge about animals' sounds. For example, a dog makes sounds like a bowwow. So the prompt should be 'Bowwow is the sound a [MASK] makes.' Also, you need to give span that, which is auditory knowledge. e.g. 'Bowwow'.

Generation Steps:

1. Read the reference about specific audio and judge whether it relates to specific animals' onomatopoeic. The reference contains text, tag, description, and category.
2. If it is related to audio knowledge about animals' sounds, generate prompts that contain [MASK] tokens and measure audio knowledge about animal sounds like 'Bowwow is the sound a [MASK] makes' and give [MASK] token answer. Also, you need to give span that, which is auditory knowledge. e.g. 'Bowwow.'
3. Your generation prompts answer should be a broad category like 'dog,' not a narrow one like 'Pomeranian.' It should be related to the animal sounds of it.
