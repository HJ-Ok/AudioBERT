You will be given information about specific audio.

Your task is to make a prompt to compare the pitch of two suggested auditory objects.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Generation Criteria:

Make a prompt if two references of audio information can compare the pitch of the sound. For example, there are two audio sounds of a dolphin and a dog. The prompt can be 'Sound of a dolphin has a [MASK] pitch than the sound of a dog.' Also, you need to give span that, which is auditory knowledge. e.g., 'Sound of a dolphin' and 'Sound of a dog.' The answer is 'higher' or 'lower' of the mask token.

Generation Steps:

1. Read the reference about two specific audio and judge whether they compare their pitches. The reference contains text, tag, description, and category.
2. If it is comparable, generate prompts that contain [MASK] tokens and compare their pitch like 'Sound of a dolphin has a [MASK] pitch than the sound of a dog' and give [MASK] token answer. Also, you need to give span that, which is auditory knowledge. e.g., 'Sound of a dolphin' and 'Sound of a dog.'
3. If it is not comparable, return 0.
4. The first audio description should be mentioned earlier in the prompt.
